        <!-- Project Overview -->
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Modern job hunting, especially in the competitive co-op space, requires an edge. This project combines the power of web scraping to identify fresh job listings and the AI capabilities of GPT-4 to generate compelling, personalized cover letters on-the-fly.</p>

        <!-- How it Works Section -->
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Job postings from major co-op job boards are scraped daily to identify new listings.</li>
            <li>Relevant details like the job title, company name, and job responsibilities are extracted.</li>
            <li>Using the extracted data, GPT-4 tailors a unique cover letter for each position, emphasizing the applicant's strengths and alignment with the job description.</li>
            <li>Users receive a notification with the job details and the generated cover letter, ready for submission.</li>
        </ul>
