        <!-- The Problem with .ipynb Files -->
        <h2>Challenges with .ipynb Files</h2>
        <p>Jupyter Notebooks, while immensely powerful, present certain challenges in a collaborative and continuous integration environment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Large file sizes due to embedded outputs (like graphs and images).</li>
            <li>Difficulties in version controlling due to JSON structure.</li>
            <li>Incompatibility with some IDEs leading to reduced productivity.</li>
            <li>Challenges in automated testing due to embedded code cells.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- The ipynb2h Solution -->
        <h3>Introducing ipynb2h</h3>
        <p>Our code extension seeks to bridge the gap between the powerful capabilities of Jupyter and the practicalities of software development workflows. With ipynb2h, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Easily convert .ipynb files to lightweight HTML for sharing and collaboration.</li>
            <li>Seamlessly integrate Jupyter Notebooks into version control systems.</li>
            <li>Facilitate automated testing by extracting pure Python code from notebooks.</li>
            <li>Enhance compatibility with a wider range of IDEs.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Benefits of Using ipynb2h -->
        <h3>Why ipynb2h?</h3>
        <p>With our tool, you're not just addressing the challenges but enhancing the way you interact with Jupyter Notebooks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Preserve notebook interactivity while benefiting from efficient storage.</li>
            <li>Make collaborative edits without the typical merge conflicts seen with .ipynb files.</li>
            <li>Integrate Jupyter into your CI/CD pipeline with ease.</li>
            <li>Enjoy faster load times and performance improvements.</li>
        </ul>
