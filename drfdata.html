        <!-- Project Overview -->
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Book Database project leverages Computer Vision to create a comprehensive database of books. Rather than manual data entry, this system uses OpenCV and Google Cloud endpoints to extract book titles and other relevant information directly from photographs of bookshelves.</p>
        <!-- How it Works Section -->
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Users upload images of their bookshelves.</li>
            <li>Image recognition software scans and identifies book spines, extracting titles and authors.</li>
            <li>The extracted data is then looked up in Google Books.</li>
            <li>Finally the comprehensive response from Books API is stored in the database.</li>
            <li>Used Bookstore X can now search, filter, and manage their book catalogue online with ease.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Potential Applications -->
        <h3>Potential Applications</h3>
        <p>This innovative approach to data entry has numerous potential applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Libraries:</strong> Individuals can quickly catalog their personal book collections.</li>
            <li><strong>Bookstores:</strong> Store owners can maintain real-time inventory and organize store layouts.</li>
            <li><strong>Libraries:</strong> Libraries can expedite their inventory processes, especially during returns and new acquisitions.</li>
            <li><strong>Research:</strong> Academics can catalog research materials efficiently for easy reference.</li>
        </ul>
